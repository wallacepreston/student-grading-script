# Student Project Grading

## Instructions

First of all, install dependencies.

  `npm i`

To pull all student repos, 
- edit student file called `students.js`, entering a new student for each array elements
- run `npm run clone the-repo-name-here` (the repo name, not the full url).  This clones all student repos into a directory called `student_projects`.
- If you have the `code` command installed with VS Code, you may instead run `npm run clone 1`.

This checks out a new `feedback` branch. 
- Make your edits/additions, and save them.

To push up your new `feedback` branch for all students:
- run `npm run push`.
